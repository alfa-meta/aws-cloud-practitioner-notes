      <rich_text scale="h2">Key Cloud Computing Characteristics:</rich_text>
      <rich_text>
    
        The following six characteristics are essential for an implementation to be considered a cloud in a true sense:
            On-demand self-service
            Broad network access
            Resource pooling
            Rapid elasticity
            Metered service
            Multitenancy
            
        </rich_text>
      <rich_text scale="h3" weight="heavy">On-demand self-service:</rich_text>
      <rich_text>
            Pay-as-you-go
            Automated requests, provisoning and use
            Typically provided by a web portal or API
            Billing is expanded or contracted based on use
            
        </rich_text>
      <rich_text scale="h3" weight="heavy">Broad Network Access:</rich_text>
      <rich_text>
            All cloud services and components are accessible over the network.
            Agnostic to the users access method.
            Removes the need for users to store data on their devices.
            
        </rich_text>
      <rich_text scale="h3" weight="heavy">Resource Pooling:</rich_text>
      <rich_text>
            Resource Pooling == Multitenancy
            Meaning there will always be a mix of applications and systems that coexist within the same set of physical and virtual resources.
            The only concern for the location of the data is with the locality of the server.
            
        </rich_text>
      <rich_text weight="heavy">Rapid Elasticity:</rich_text>
      <rich_text>
            Services can be rapidly expanded or contracted as needed.
        
        </rich_text>
      <rich_text weight="heavy">Metered Service:</rich_text>
      <rich_text>
            Depending on the type of service and cloud implementation, resources are metered and logged for billing and utilization reporting.
            
        </rich_text>
      <rich_text weight="heavy">Multitenancy:</rich_text>
      <rich_text>
            Multiple customers using the same hardware that is isolated using software.
            
        </rich_text>
      <rich_text weight="heavy">Virtualization:</rich_text>
      <rich_text>
            Noone needs to add computing resources when the demand increases.
            All resources are virtually allocated.

      <rich_text weight="heavy">S3</rich_text>
      <rich_text>) - offers object storage at incredibly high availability levels.
                S3 is an object file system that is flat in nature and stores files within a bucket.
                All objects are on the same level.
                Use alpha-numeric key value for an object name, which can be up to 1,024 bytes long.
                Each bucket can only exist within one region.
                Bucket names must be globally unique.
                
                S3 Storage Classes:
                    S3 Standard - used for commonly accessed data and is optimized for high throughput and low-latency service.
                        Used widely for cloud applications, websites, content distribution, and data analytics.
                    
                    S3 Intelligent-Tiering - best used for data where usage patterns are unknonw or may change over time.
                        Spans two tiers:
                            Frequent and Lesser Access.
                            If an object is not accessed for 30 days it is moved to Lesser Access.
                            When an object has been accessed it is moved to frequent access for 30 days.
                            Two tier access requires an additional fee.
                            
                    S3 Standard-Infrequent Access - ideally used where access will be infrequent for an object, but when access is requested, a quick response is necessary.
                    
                    S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access - ideal for data that is infrequently used, requires quick access when it is accessed, but does not require the robust fault tolerance and replication of other S3 classes.
                    
                    
                S3 Permissions:
                    AWS S3 offers three different layers of permissions and security controls on S3 objects: bucket, user, and object access control lists.
                    Can be granted at a user level via IAM.
                    ACLs for buckets have been superseeded by S3 bucket and user policies.
                    
                S3 Encryption:
                	When you upload any objects to S3, the data within the objeect is static and written to storage within the AWS infrastructure.
                	S3 automatically encrypts data objects that you upload before they are stored and will decrypt them when accessed and pass the data back to you.
                	S3 allows you to use your own key for encryption.
                
				S3 Versioning:
					By default, when you update an object in S3, it overwrites and replaces what you previously had uploaded.
					By enabling S3 Versioning all deleted and uploaded files remain to be saved just in a different instance. Adds additional costs.
                
                S3 Object Life Cycle:
                	To help manage versioning in AWS S3, the service provides automation tools, called actions to handle how versions are stored and when they are removed from the system.
                		Transition - action will move S3 objects to a different storage class after it reaches a certain age. Allows you to use cheaper storage.
                		Expiration - action will automatically expire and remove objects once they reach a certain date.
                
                S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep:
                	S3 Glacier is a special type of S3 storage that is intended to be a secure solution for long-term data archiving and backups. 
                	S3 Glacier comes with three retrieval options:
                		Expedited - offers retrieval options that will typically return within one to five minutes. 
               			
               			Standard - offers retrieval options that will typically return in three to five hours.
               
               			Bulk - Offers retrieval times of 5 to 12 hours and is the best option for very large retrievals.
                
                	With S3 Glacier Deep the retrieval types are between 12 and 48 hours.
                
					S3 Glacier is fully integrated with CloudTrail for full logging and auditing.

Highly Available and Scalable Resources:
	Design Multiple layers of redundancy so that whenever one component fails, its workload is automatically and instantly moved to a healthy replacement. This is known as “failover”.
	
	Connect resources in geographically remote locations so that the failure of one complete region could trigger a predefined relocation of resources. This relocation can be supported by a similarly automated rerouting of network requests.
	
	Provide customers with access to as much compute power as they could possibly need and deliver it on-demand.
	
	Low price for scale.
	
	
Capital Expenses (CapEx) - cloud operations involve virtually no CapEx.

Operating Expenses (OpEx)

Virtualization benefits:
	Speed - restarting a VM can sometimes happen faster than you can type your login details.
	
	Efficiency - multiple virtual machines can be tightly packed onto a physical server running a hypervisor.
	
	
Cloud Platform Models:
	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - give you direct access to a provider's compute, storage, and networking assets.
	
		Products include:
			Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
			Elastic Block Store (EBS) - for storage volumes
			Elastic Load Balancing
			
	Platform as a Service (PaaS) - you are given an interface through which you define the behaviour and environment you want for your application. Usually involves code.
		Examples include:
			Elastic Beanstalk
			Elastic Container Service (ECS)
	
	Software as a Service (SaaS) - offers services meant to be accessed by end users.
		Examples include:
			Gmail
			Outlook
			AWS Simple Email Service
			Amazon WorkSpaces
	
	
	Serverless Workloads - uses reactive functions instead of servers to deal with events.
	Serverless allows for individual developers to run their code for seconds or minutes at a time on someone else's cloud servers.
	
	
	
Scalability and Elasticity:

	Scalability - term used to refer to services that will automaitcally grow in capacity to seamlessly meet any changes in demand.
	
	Elasticity - term used to refer to services increasing and decreasing in performance levels to better suit the current use case of your application.</rich_text>

	AWS Global Infrastructure:
		
		Regionally Based Services:
			Any individual instance is only hosted on one region at any given time.
		
		Globally Based Services:
			AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) - is the service for managing access to your account via users, groups, roles and policies.
			
			Amazon CloudFront - is the content delivery network you can use to lower access latency for your application users by storing cached versions of frequently requested data at AWS edge locations.
		
			Amazon S3 - is a global service
		
	Availability Zones:
		
		An AWS region encompasses at least two distinct availability Zones (AZ) connected to each other with low-latency network links.		
		
		Availability Zone Designations:
			When launching an EC2 instance, you'll need to specify a network subnet associated with an AZ.
		
		Availability Zone Networking:
			AWS permits up to 200 subnets per AZ.

	Edge Locations:
		Edge location - is a site where AWS deploys physical server infrastructure to provide low-latency user access to Amazon-based data.
		
		Amazon Route 53 - Amazon's Domain Name System (DNS) administration tool for managing domain name registration and traffic routing.
		
		AWS Shield - A managed service for countering the threat of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against your AWS-based infrastructure.
		
		AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) - A managed service for protecting web applications from web-based threats.
		
		Lambda@Edge - A tool designed to use the serverless power of Lambda to customize CloudFront Behaviour.		
		
		Regional Edge Cache - CloudFront served objects are maintained in edge location caches only as long as there's steady flow of requests.
		
	Extending the Cloud:
		
		AWS Outposts - fully managed service that brings native AWS infrastructure and services to customers on-premises data centers or colocation facilities.
			Allows customers to run AWS services, APIs, and tools locally, providing consistent hybrid cloud experience.
		
		AWS Local Zones - geographically distinct from AWS regions. Designed to serve specific cities or metropolitan areas with ultra-low latency access to services running in Local Zone data centers.
			Covered services include - Elastic Compute Cloud, Elastic Block Store, Amazon File Storage.
		
		AWS Wavelength - also addresses the need for ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth connections to mobile devices and users. Using 5G Cellular network.
			Allows edge-based machine learning applications and augmented reality or vr deployments.
		
	The AWS Shared Responsibility Model:
		
		Managed Resources:
			RDS is partially managed since you dont need to patch it AWS does.
			Elastic Beanstalk - hides all the runtime environment complexities and only leaves you with the applcation code.
			
		Unmanaged Resources:
			EC2 - you are expected to care for the operating system and everything that's still running on it exactly the way you would for a physical server in your on-premises data center.</rich_text>

      <rich_text scale="h2">Database Models:</rich_text>
      <rich_text>

	Relational Databases - attribute and record storage system where data is stored in tables of rows and collumns.
		Each row is unique.
		
	SQL - you can create databases and tables to read and write data to. You can also perform tuning and maintenance tasks.
	
	Nonrelational (No-SQL) Databases:
		NoSQL - were developed to provide a fast alternative for applications that need to perform tens of thousands of reads or writes per second.
		
		Amazon ElastiCache - frequently accessed database storage solution.
			Can be used with Memcached or Redis. 
		
		Amazon MemoryDB - is a full-fledged redis database that provides persistent, nonrelational database storage and caching.

</rich_text>
      <rich_text scale="h2">Amazon Relational Database Service:</rich_text>
      <rich_text>
	RDS - is Amazon's managed relational database service.
		RDS allows you to provision - Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
		RDS allows you to connect to a VPC of your choice.
		RDS uses Elastic Block Service (EBS) volumes for storage.
		
	MultiAvailability zone (multi-AZ) - has database instances in multiple availability zones.
	
	Database Engines:
		RDBMS choices to be installed on your instance.
		Examples include -- MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Aurora.
		
	Licensing:
		License Included - pricing is included in the pricing for each RDS instance.
		
		Bring Your Own License - you must provide your own license to operate the database engine.
		
	Instance Class:
		When you deploy RDS you must choose a database instance class that defines the number of virtual CPUs.
		
	Standard Instance Class:
		Between 2 and 96 vCPU
		8-384 GB Memory
	
	Memory Optimized Instance Class:
		For most demanding database requirements.
		Most disk throughput and network bandwidth.
		4 to 128 vCPUS
		122 - 3,904 GB Memory.
	
	Burstable Performance Instance Class:
		Designed for test and dev environments.
		Lowest network bandwidth and disk throughput.
		2 and 8 vCPUs
		1-32 GB memory
		
	Scaling Vertically - making an instance more powerful.
	
	Input/Output operations per second (IOPS) define how fast you can read and write to a volume.
	New RDS instances use EBS volumes
	
	RDS provides three types of Storage:
		
		General-Purpose SSD - 
			Volumes between 20GB and 32 TB
			IOPS depend on how much storage you allocate.
		
		Provisioned IOPS SSD - allows you to specify the exact number of IOPS that you want to allocate per volume.
			Up to 32 TB.
			Maximum number of IOPS must be decided before provisioning.
			
		
		Magnetic - legacy storage for backwards compatibility.
			Does not use EBS.
			Limited to 4TB and 1,000 IOPS.
			Can increase, cannot decrease in storage size.
			Migration causes an outage.
			Migrating from magnetic to EBS can take up to several days.
			
	Read Replica - an RDS instance that only reads from the database.
	In a relational database, only the master database instance can write to the database.
	
	High Availability with Multi-AZ:
		Multi-AZ creates an additional RDS isntance called a standby database instance.
		It runs in a different availability zone than your primary database.
		RDS automatically fails over to the secondary db.
		Failover can result in an outage of up to two minutes,
		
		With AZ you can expect a monthly availability of 99.95%
		AZ can be used with Aurora which is used with RDS.
		Aurora Cluster can be used with RDS it allows for synchronously replicated shared storage volume across three different availability zones.
		
	Backup and Recovery:
		Snapshots of manual or EBS of your instances are stored across multiple availability zones.
		Snapshots can be used to create copies of your RDS instances.
		
		Snapshots enable point-in-time recovery.
		
	Determining Your Recovery Point Objecting:
		Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - is the data loss that you can sustain in the event of a failure.
		1 hour of tolerated data loss is RPO of 1 hour.
		
	Migrating Data to Your Database:
		
		AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) - supports migrating Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle databases to Aurora MySQL, MySQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, and PostgreSQL databases.
		
		AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) - is a locally downloadable program on Windows or Linux.

      <rich_text>

	Cloud Computing - the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
	
	Dedicated Server:
		One physical machine dedicated to a single business.
		Runs a single web-app/site.
		Very Expensive, High Maintenance, *High Security
	
	Virtual Private Server:
		One physical machine dedicated to a single business.
		The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines.
		Runs multiple web-apps/sites.
		Better Utilization and Isolation of Resources.
	
	Shared Hosting:
		One Physical machine, shared by hundreds of businesses.
		Relies on most tentants under-utilizing their resources.
		Very Cheap, Limited functionality, Poor Isolation.
	
	Cloud Hosting:
		Multiple Physical machines act as one system.
		System is abstracted into multiple cloud services.
		Flexible, Scalable, Secure, Cost-Effective, High Configurability.</rich_text>

	Compute - imagine having a virtual computer that can run application, programs and code.
	
	Networking - imagive having virtual network defining internet connections or network isolations between services or outbound to the internet.
	
	Storage - imagine having a virtual hard-drive that can store files.
	
	Databases - imagine a virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web-application.

	SaaS - product that is run and managed by the service provider.
		For Customers
		
	PaaS - focus on the deployment and management of your apps.
		For Developers
		
	IaaS - the basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provdes access to networking features, computers and data storage space.
	
Availability Zones:
	AZ - is a physical location made up of one or more datacenter.
	Region contains 3 availability zones.
	
	Datacenter is a secured building that contains hundreds of thousands of computers.
	
	Datacenters within a region will isolate from each other but they will be close enough to provide low-latency
	
	Its common practice to run workloads in at least 3 AZs to ensure services remain available in case one or two datacenters fail.</rich_text>
