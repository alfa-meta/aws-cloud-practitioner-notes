			<rich_text scale="h2">Key Cloud Computing Characteristics:</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
    
        The following six characteristics are essential for an implementation to be considered a cloud in a true sense:
            On-demand self-service
            Broad network access
            Resource pooling
            Rapid elasticity
            Metered service
            Multitenancy
            
        </rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="h3" weight="heavy">On-demand self-service:</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
            Pay-as-you-go
            Automated requests, provisoning and use
            Typically provided by a web portal or API
            Billing is expanded or contracted based on use
            
        </rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="h3" weight="heavy">Broad Network Access:</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
            All cloud services and components are accessible over the network.
            Agnostic to the users access method.
            Removes the need for users to store data on their devices.
            
        </rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="h3" weight="heavy">Resource Pooling:</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
            Resource Pooling == Multitenancy
            Meaning there will always be a mix of applications and systems that coexist within the same set of physical and virtual resources.
            The only concern for the location of the data is with the locality of the server.
            
        </rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">Rapid Elasticity:</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
            Services can be rapidly expanded or contracted as needed.
        
        </rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">Metered Service:</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
            Depending on the type of service and cloud implementation, resources are metered and logged for billing and utilization reporting.
            
        </rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">Multitenancy:</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
            Multiple customers using the same hardware that is isolated using software.
            
        </rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">Virtualization:</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
            Noone needs to add computing resources when the demand increases.
            All resources are virtually allocated.
        
        
</rich_text>

            Monitoring,
            Enforcement,
            
            Discovery and Classification is the first stage
            Finding all the data that is pertinent to the DLP and ensuring that all instances of it are known and able to be exposed to the DLP solution.
            
            Monitoring is the second stage
            Encompasses the core function and purpose of a DLP strategy.
            Involved process of watching data as it moves through the various states of usage to ensure it is being used in appropriate and controlled ways.

			<rich_text>- production environments are protected by the masking process being implemented between the application and data layers of application.
                Allows for a masking translation to take place live in the system and during normal application processing of data.
                Used when system needs to have full and unmasked data but certain users only need partial data.

			<rich_text> (</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">S3</rich_text>
			<rich_text>) - offers object storage at incredibly high availability levels.
                S3 is an object file system that is flat in nature and stores files within a bucket.
                All objects are on the same level.
                Use alpha-numeric key value for an object name, which can be up to 1,024 bytes long.
                Each bucket can only exist within one region.
                Bucket names must be globally unique.
                
                S3 Storage Classes:
                    S3 Standard - used for commonly accessed data and is optimized for high throughput and low-latency service.
                        Used widely for cloud applications, websites, content distribution, and data analytics.
                    
                    S3 Intelligent-Tiering - best used for data where usage patterns are unknonw or may change over time.
                        Spans two tiers:
                            Frequent and Lesser Access.
                            If an object is not accessed for 30 days it is moved to Lesser Access.
                            When an object has been accessed it is moved to frequent access for 30 days.
                            Two tier access requires an additional fee.
                            
                    S3 Standard-Infrequent Access - ideally used where access will be infrequent for an object, but when access is requested, a quick response is necessary.
                    
                    S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access - ideal for data that is infrequently used, requires quick access when it is accessed, but does not require the robust fault tolerance and replication of other S3 classes.
                    
                    
                S3 Permissions:
                    AWS S3 offers three different layers of permissions and security controls on S3 objects: bucket, user, and object access control lists.
